# Feature Specs

Use this area for one feature per document.

## What Belongs Here

- feature behavior
- feature scope
- acceptance criteria
- feature-specific business logic
- links to related flows, APIs, entities, and decisions

## What Does Not Belong Here

- reusable cross-feature rules that belong in [business_rules.md](../02_requirements/confirmed/business_rules.md)
- sequence logic that belongs in [04_flows/README.md](../04_flows/README.md)
- architectural trade-offs that belong in [06_decisions/README.md](../06_decisions/README.md)

## Current State

- Canonical feature specs now exist for the core, authoring, retrieval, and verification areas of the wiki system.
- Domain folders currently in use:
  - `core/`
  - `authoring/`
  - `retrieval/`
  - `verification/`
  - `other/`
- Use this README as the folder entry point, then follow the real feature docs for topic-specific behavior.

## Additional Canonical Docs

- [TaskFlow SaaS Auth Foundation MVP](other/feature-taskflow-auth-foundation-mvp.md) - proposed canonical feature doc for the Week 1 flagship-product auth foundation slice
